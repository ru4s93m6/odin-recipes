          Light, yet full of flavor, this pesto is perfect tossed with hot
          spaghetti for a quick dinner. It is also excellent as a pizza sauce or
          smeared on hot French bread. It freezes well to preserve the bounty of
          summer basil.

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol aria-label="Preparation steps">
          <li>
            Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti
            at a boil until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 12
            minutes; drain. Transfer spaghetti to a large bowl.
          </li>
          <li>
            Put cubed Romano cheese in the bowl of a food processor; process
            until coarsely grated, about 30 seconds. Put garlic into the food
            processor and process until the cheese and garlic are combined. Add
            spinach, basil, walnuts, lemon juice, lemon zest, and salt; process
            until the mixture comes together into a thick paste. Scrape down the
            sides of the bowl with a spatula.
          </li>
          <li>
            With food processor running, drizzle olive oil into the mixture.
            Continue processing until the oil is integrated smoothly.
          </li>
          <li>Pour sauce over spaghetti and toss to coat.</li>
