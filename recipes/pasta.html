            Light, yet full of flavor, this pesto is perfect tossed with hot
            spaghetti for a quick dinner. It is also excellent as a pizza sauce
            or smeared on hot French bread. It freezes well to preserve the
            bounty of summer basil.

          <ol aria-label="Preparation steps">
            <li>
              Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook
              spaghetti at a boil until cooked through but firm to the bite,
              about 12 minutes; drain. Transfer spaghetti to a large bowl.
            </li>
            <li>
              Put cubed Romano cheese in the bowl of a food processor; process
              until coarsely grated, about 30 seconds. Put garlic into the food
              processor and process until the cheese and garlic are combined.
              Add spinach, basil, walnuts, lemon juice, lemon zest, and salt;
              process until the mixture comes together into a thick paste.
              Scrape down the sides of the bowl with a spatula.
            </li>
            <li>
              With food processor running, drizzle olive oil into the mixture.
              Continue processing until the oil is integrated smoothly.
