          <h2>Directions</h2>
          <ol aria-label="Preparation steps">
            <li>
              Position oven rack in center of oven and preheat to 350 degrees F
              (175 degrees C). Coat a 9-inch square baking pan with cooking
              spray. Line bottom of pan with parchment paper and coat parchment
              with cooking spray.
            </li>
            <li>
              Whisk together flour, baking powder, and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a
              medium bowl. In another medium bowl, rub white sugar and lemon
              zest together with your hands until well combined (sugar will
              start to turn yellow).
            </li>
            <li>
              In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat
              10 tablespoons butter and the lemon zest mixture at medium speed
              until light and fluffy, 4 to 5 minutes. Add eggs, one at a time,
              mixing at medium speed and scraping bowl well after each addition.
            </li>
            <li>
              Mix in about one-third of flour mixture at low speed. Mix in 1/3
              cup sour cream. Scrape bowl well. Mix in another one-third of
              flour mixture, then mix in 3 tablespoons lemon juice and remaining
              1/3 cup sour cream. Scrape bowl well. Mix in remaining one-third
              of flour mixture until incorporated and batter is smooth.
            </li>
            <li>
              Pour batter into prepared pan and spread in an even layer. Bake
              until cake springs back lightly when touched in center, 25 to 30
              minutes. Transfer pan to a wire rack and let cool completely.
            </li>
            <li>
              For frosting, put cream cheese and remaining 6 tablespoons butter
              in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment (bowl
              should be clean and dry). Beat at medium-high speed until fluffy,
              about 2 minutes. Gradually mix in 3/4 cup powdered sugar at medium
              speed until incorporated.
            </li>
            <li>
              With mixer running at medium speed, add whipping cream, 2
              tablespoons lemon juice, and remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt until
              fully incorporated.
            </li>
            <li>
              When cake is cool, run a small offset spatula around outside edge
              and invert onto a cutting board. Spread frosting evenly over top
              of cake. Loosely cover cake with plastic wrap and freeze until
              firm, 1 to 2 hours.
            </li>
            <li>
              Use a long sharp knife to cut cake into 12 even rectangles. Line a
              baking sheet with parchment paper; put a wire rack on baking sheet
              and arrange cake pieces on rack.
            </li>
            <li>
              For glaze, whisk together milk, vanilla, and remaining 3 cups
              powdered sugar and 5 tablespoons lemon juice in a medium bowl
              until a drizzly glaze forms.
            </li>
            <li>
              Spoon glaze evenly over cake pieces, using offset spatula to
              spread evenly and allowing excess to drip off sides.
            </li>
            <li>
              Gently slide offset spatula under each cake piece to transfer to
              an airtight storage container. Chill until ready to serve (or up
              to 4 days).
