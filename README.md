# odin-recipes

This is the first project from The Odin Project course. It's a simple recipe website showcasing basic HTML skills.

[Live Site DEMO](https://ru4s93m6.github.io/odin-recipes/)

## Project Description

The website currently contains several recipe pages, each structured with semantic HTML. While the page isn't very visually appealing at the moment, CSS will be added in the future to enhance its appearance.

## Reflections

Although I've learned HTML before, this project has been valuable for reinforcing solid foundations and refreshing my memory.

## Additional Techniques Used

In addition to the techniques covered in the course, I've implemented the following:

- Meta tags with description for better SEO
- Main tag to clearly define the primary content area
- Section tags to organize major content blocks
- ARIA-label attributes for unordered and ordered lists to improve accessibility for screen readers

## Future Improvements

- Add CSS to enhance the visual design of the website
- Implement responsive design for better mobile viewing
- Possibly add JavaScript for interactive features

## How to View

To view the project, simply clone this repository and open the index.html file in your web browser.
