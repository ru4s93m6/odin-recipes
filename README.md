# odin-recipes

This is the first project from The Odin Project course. It's a simple recipe website showcasing basic HTML skills.

[Live Site DEMO](https://ru4s93m6.github.io/odin-recipes/)

## Project Description

The website currently contains several recipe pages, each structured with semantic HTML. It's a project for practicing basic HTML tags and creating a multi-page website structure. Key features include:

- A main index page with links to recipes
- Individual recipe pages with ingredients and instructions
- Use of various HTML elements like `<h1>`, `<p>`, `<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<figure>`, `<figcaption>` and `<img>` etc.

## Reflections

Although I've learned HTML before, this project has been valuable for reinforcing solid foundations and refreshing my memory.

## Additional Techniques Used

In addition to the techniques covered in the course, I've implemented the following:

- Meta tags with description for better SEO
- Main tag to clearly define the primary content area
- Section tags to organize major content blocks
- ARIA-label attributes for unordered and ordered lists to improve accessibility for screen readers

- Basic CSS style was implemented after taking some lessons
